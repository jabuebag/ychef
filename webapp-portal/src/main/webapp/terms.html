                <p>Ychef  does not sell or rent your information. We disclose your Personal Information only when:
                We have your explicit permission to share your Personal Information.

                We determine that the access, preservation, or disclosure of Personal Information is required or permitted by law to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Ychef and its Users, or is required to comply with applicable laws, including compliance with warrants, court orders, or other legal process.</p>

                <p>We share your Personal Information in connection with the sale or reorganization of all or part of our business, as permitted by applicable law.</p>

If you and a Chef enter into a confirmed transaction with one another (the Chef accepts your request, and your payment details are collected and processed), then your Personal Information and the Personal Information of the Chef is exchanged in order to facilitate the Event. In no event is your Billing Information shared with the Chef.</p>
